                Many sisters turn on the microphone by mistake. In many cases it
                has been seen that many people keep the video on. All students
                and teachers were embarrassed by this. These things should be
                taken special care. A few precautions can be taken for this: -
                You can cover a paper in front of the camera with scotch tape or
                something. So that even if the video is turned on by mistake,
                the video cannot be seen. There are some apps that cause the
                screen to be fixed. If this app is installed, just pull down
                from the top to lock the screen. Now no matter how much the
                screen is touched, nothing will work. Only 2/4/5 times tapping
                on the marked location will unlock the screen. Class will not be
                a problem.

                In the case of tajweed, those who have secured the highest marks

                Alhamdulillah all Madhhab or Manhaj are right. However, since
                95% of our students are of the Hanafi Madhhab, when there is a
                discussion about prayer or other matters, the rules of Hanafi
                Fiqh must be discussed and it must be said that those who are
                following other rules are also okay. Because the purpose of IOM
                is not to establish any sect or sect but to make everyone dāʿī

            Only students can join this group. Inshallah if Allah wills, we hope
            to stay in the group till our last day. In addition to studying,
            sharing handnotes, we expect some other things in the group as
            members of this group. Today, the practice of religion has
            completely disappeared from our society. In our society today, the
            amount of sin committed in one day at a wedding seems to be more
            than the sin of the entire month in that area. Reunion is dead
            today. Today, if someone dies, his relatives from abroad are buried.
            And except reciting prayers for the dead person in the meeting, the
            feelings of meeting everyone after such a long time started to be
            shared. Considering these issues, we want the Prophet (PBUH) and his
            Companions (RA) to stand by each other in all matters of birth,
            death and marriage. We expect the same from IOM.

                <strong>Class Rules:</strong>
                <br />
                1. Political posts: No political posts can be given in groups or
                chats. It is natural that different students will have different
                political ideologies. But there is no need for everyone to agree
                with my ideology.
                <br />
                2. Religious Controversial Posts: No controversial posts that
                may cause religious controversy can be given or shared. Only
                encouraging posts can be given.
                <br />
                3. Madhhab Controversy: IOM is always respectful of all Madhhabs
                or Manhaj. No post or discussion that creates controversy about
                Madhhab can be given or discussed. Neither for nor against. IOM
                believes that all schools of thought are correct. On the other
                hand, differences regarding Madhhab are mostly limited to nafl.
                There is no difference of opinion about the rest of the farz. So
                there is no room to create controversy about Nafal.
                <br />
                4. Hatred: I may personally dislike an alem or scholar. But it
                is completely forbidden to post or share posts by mocking anyone
                here.
                <br />
                5. Donation collection: কোন প্রতিষ্ঠান বা ব্যাক্তির জন্য
                অর্থসংগ্রহের জন্য কোন ধরনের পোষ্ট বা চ্যাটিং দিতে হলে অবশ্যই
                এডমিনের অনুমতি সাপেক্ষে দিতে পারবে। এডমিনের অনুমতি ব্যতিত কোন
                ধরনের দান সংগ্রহ সম্পূর্ন নিষিদ্ধ।
