        Alhamdulillah Was Salamu Ala Rasulillah. Wa Ala Alihi Wa Ashabihi Wa
        Maan Walah. <br />
        <br />
        The first revelation that was revealed to the Prophet in the Cave of
        Hera was - Read in the name of your Lord who created. He created man
        from clotted blood. Surely your Lord is Most Merciful. He who taught
        through the pen. He taught people what he did not know (Surah: Al-Alak,
        Verse No.: 1-5). <br /> <br />
        Just as worldly education is needed to maintain the rules and management
        of the world, religious education is needed for the preservation of
        religion and for all the affairs of the world to be in accordance with
        the pleasure of Allah. In order for all sections of the Muslim society
        to be able to follow the religion and live a halal life without the
        haram, it is essential to have a Jamaat versed in the Qur'an and Sunnah.
        In the Qur'an Majeed, why does not a group go out from every community,
        so that they may achieve Tafaqquh in the religion and show fear to their
        nation when they return to them. Perhaps they will gain the fear of God
        (Surah Tawbah, verse no: 122). <br /> <br />
        In order to open various opportunities for knowledge practice, IOM
        offers many short courses in addition to Alim courses.

        <p className="mt-4 ">
          About the year 2018... I must remember that at the beginning of the
          story I told about two travelers from different positions. Yes. One of
          them is Mufti Zubair Ahmad and another engineer Khandaker Marsus.
          Mufti Zubair Ahmad is a famous scholar and researcher and eminent
          authority on comparative theology, who has helped many non-Muslims to
          become Muslims by showing them the light of Islam using his Dawati
          method, every word of whose speech pours peace into the heart, awakens
          the pain of religion among the Ummah. On the other hand, Engineer
          Khandaker Marsus is an educated and talented person who has done
          Post-Graduate on IT Engineering and Business Management, whose mind
          always has new plans, initiatives, and efforts for the wisdom of the
          Ummah. The plan of how to revolutionize the religion by using his
          worldly knowledge and intelligence continues. Ma sha Allah only little
          can be said about both. Both are always busy with the thought of
          increasing the Fiqh of the Deen among the updated generation. May this
          dedication of theirs for the sake of religion reach Arshe Azeem
          forever. <br /> <br />
          Popular platform like Islamic Online Madrasah-IOM have been
          established today by the joint initiative of these two noble souls.
          Although the educational qualifications of these two people were
          different, the intentions and desires hidden in the corner of the
          heart were completely the same. Selflessly preaching religion among
          the Ummah. The Lord may have just kept the two positions different so
          that he could bring gold to the union of the two. An online education
          system named Islamic Online Madrasah-IOM has been formed so that every
          word of Al-Furqan can reach the doorstep of people of any age, class
          and profession, any sect or religion, and the words of guidance can
          take the form of dawah. It is basically a dawah platform of Deen. IOM
          is equally respectful of all ideologies. It is not intended to promote
          any particular group of Madhhab-Manhaj. <br /> <br />
          IOM was formally inaugurated on 1st Muharram 1440 (11-Sep-2018) in
          Masjid-e-Nababi in Madinah (although this website was created on:
          17-Oct-2017). Syllabus planning of Alim course was also done sitting
          in Masjid-e-Nababi Alhamdulillah. It is a special grace of Allah that
          He started the tour of IOM in the holiest place at the holiest time!
          Subhanallah!
          <br /> <br /> <br />
          The first batch of our Madrasa started in 2018. 132 students enrolled
          in the first batch! Out of which 16/17 were MBBS doctors, 22 were
          engineers and students from different countries were admitted
          Alhamdulillah!
          <br /> <br />
          Alhamdulillah since the beginning till now we are getting great
          response from brothers and sisters. Currently we have 5 batches
          running Alhamdulillah. <br /> <br />
          Today Islamic Online Madrasah-IOM is gradually progressing in the path
          of light... at its own pace... in its own manner, in the infinite
          blessings of Allah. <br /> <br />
          Finally all praises to Allah Subhanahu Ta'ala, who has given us so
          much opportunity to acquire religious knowledge, making IOM a place of
          love for every good soul. Our IOM has taken the form of a sea of peace
          to quench the thirst of the souls who are wandering like sparrows in
          search of religious knowledge, completely away from factionalism and
          looking for a right-wing platform. IOM is now a beloved name among
          scholars who are seeking knowledge. <br /> <br />
          May Almighty Allah transform this academy from big to bigger, and give
          good reward to all those who are behind this great work, open the way
          of charity to all and accept everyone in the path of his religion.
          Ameen.
